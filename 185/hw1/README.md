# Chi-squre test 

In this file, we focus on research about the data from "natality-california-2022.txt", which consist of the birth information in the california in 2022. We also want to apply chi squre test to check the association between 2 different variables and plot the power curve of the chi-squre test.

## Q1

1. Check if the chance of a baby being born a girl is the same across counties in California.
2. Null hypothesis: Yes, the chance are the same 
3. Filter out the girls/boys information from the dataset, organized by different counties 
4. Get the probability of girl and apply chi-squre test 
5. Depend on the p value, if less than threshold, then reject the null hopythesis, else otherwise. 

## Q2
1. Plot power curve of Chi-squared Test 

## Q3
1. Apply ggplot to visualized the data and observe if there is any pattern in the dataset 
2. Test for association: apply Pearson's Chi-squared test
