# HW# 2

In this file, we use Monte Carlo simulation to simulate possible data points. Apply the goodness of fit test to check if the data follows the uniform distribution. We also plot a box plot to visualize our data points.

## Q1

1. We use Monte Carlo simulations to study the distribution of p-values obtained from Pearson chi-squared tests for various combinations of the number of categories (k) and sample sizes (n * k). 
2. By repeatedly sampling data and performing the tests, the code can evaluate how the distribution of p-values behaves under the null hypothesis, providing insight into the performance and correctness of the chi-squared test under different conditions.

## Q2
1. Use boxplot visualize the Quantile Calculation. 

## Q3
1. Apply goodness-of-fit test to evaluate whether the given dataset x follows a uniform distribution.
2. Using a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate a series of a number and perform  Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, which is a type of goodness-of-fit test. Compare the EDF and the CDF of the reference distribution.
