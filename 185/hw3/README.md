# HW# 3 

In this file, we get the summary of the data, draw the historgram as well as the boxplot to visualize the data point. Apply Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test to see if 2 data has the same type of distribution.

## Q1

1. Use chi-square goodness-of-fit test to determine whether the observed distribution of global sales of video games in 2010 follows a Poisson distribution.
2. It generates expected counts using a Poisson distribution, compares these expected counts to the observed counts, and visualizes the observed distribution with a bar plot. 
3. The problem it addresses is assessing the fit of the observed data to the hypothesized Poisson distribution.

## Q2
1. The flipSignTest function performs a permutation test (flip sign test) to assess whether the mean of the given dataset x is significantly different from zero.


## Q3
1. Apply Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U Test)
2. This test can be used to compare two independent samples to determine whether their population distributions differ. It does not assume a normal distribution of the data.
