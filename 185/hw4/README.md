## Q1

1. Use violin plot to visulize the data 
2. Apply Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate whether the distributions of the different groups are the same. For example: null hypothesis: all groups have the same median. 
3. It does not assume a normal distribution of the data. Suitable for ordinal data or continuous data that is not normally distributed.

## Q2
1. Similar to Q1, apply Kruskal-Wallis test 


## Q3
1. Apply both Welch's F-test and Welch's t-Test 
2. Welch's F-Test: Used for comparing means of three or more groups under unequal variances.
3. Welch's t-Test: Used for comparing means of two groups under unequal variances.
Holm Correction: Adjusts p-values for multiple testing to control the family-wise error rate.
4. Plot power curve to compare the performance of above 2 test.
