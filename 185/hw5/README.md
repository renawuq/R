# HW# 5
We apply pearson's correlation test to test the correlation between 2 dataset. Use kruskal.test to determine the association between 2 data. Use gggplot to visulize the datapoint and by linear regression, find a line fit those point.

## Q1

1. Use cor.test (Pearson’s correlation test) to test the corrlation between 2 dataset. 
2. Use kruskal.test to determine the association between 2 data. 
3. Use box plot of p value to determine the difference / association between different features. 

## Q2
1. Also use the Pearson’s correlation test
2. Use ggplot plot the datapoint represent the correlation
3. Find the linear regression line associate with the data 


## Q3
1. Apply the same hting we did for q1 and q2
2. visulize our result
